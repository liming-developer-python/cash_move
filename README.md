Laravel NFT point Management Admin Dashboard
--------------------------------------

Laravel is a web application framework with an expressive, elegant syntax designed to make developing web apps easier and faster through built-in features. Laravel strives to provide an amazing developer experience, while providing powerful features such as thorough dependency injection, an expressive database abstraction layer, queues and scheduled jobs, unit and integration testing, and more.

In our solution, we will be using the TALL stack which is a full-stack development solution which combines a set of tools as a way of easily and quickly building applications. The TALL stack consists of the following:

Tailwind CSS - A utility-first CSS framework
AlpineJS - A minimal frontend development framework for adding JavaScript behavior to HTML markups
Livewire - Building dynamic interfaces simple, without leaving the comfort of Laravel.
Note that this guide also applies to anyone who wishes to uses another front-end framework like Vue & React while using any PHP framework as your back-end. Inertia.js allows you to create fully client-side rendered, single-page apps, without much of the complexity that comes with modern SPAs. It does this by leveraging existing server-side frameworks, like Laravel and Rails.

Before we get started, I highly recommend you to read this excellent article by Jason Weathersby on the different approaches NFTs can be implemented on the Algorand blockchain. We will be focusing on the primary method to build and deploy an NFT which is by using the ASA (Algorand Standard Assets), a layer 1 primitive that allows an NFT to be created in seconds.
